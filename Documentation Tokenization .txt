1-StemmingLemmatization

#import re
Imports Python's built-in re module for working with regular expressions. It is used for tasks like pattern matching, string searching, and text processing.
import nltk

#Imports the nltk library
a popular toolkit for NLP. It provides various tools and resources for processing and analyzing human language.
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

#Imports the PorterStemmer
a stemming algorithm that reduces words to their root form. For example, "running" becomes "run." This is useful for simplifying text analysis by standardizing words.
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

#Imports the WordNetLemmatizer
which performs lemmatization. Unlike stemming, lemmatization reduces words to their base or dictionary form, considering the context (e.g., "better" becomes "good").
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

#Imports the word_tokenize function
which breaks a text string into individual words (tokens). For example, "Hello, world!" becomes ["Hello", ",", "world", "!"].
nltk.download('punkt')

#Downloads the Punkt tokenizer models,
necessary for tokenizing text into words or sentences. The Punkt package is essential for word_tokenize to work.
nltk.download('wordnet')

#Downloads the WordNet corpus,
a lexical database of the English language, required for lemmatization using WordNetLemmatizer.
